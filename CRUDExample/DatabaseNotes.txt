When creating a database with EF Core
- Run "Add-Migration" in the package manager console
to create code first migrations when the database needs to 
be updated
- Run "Update-Database" to apply migrations to target database



To get the database set up manually
- Required NuGet packages: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/intro?view=aspnetcore-7.0#ef-core-nuget-packages
- Create Database context class by creating a class
that inherits from DbContext. Docs here
